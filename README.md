# learncpp_followalong

This is a central repo for all my code related to [LearnCPP](https://www.learncpp.com/) lessons. While working through chapters 1 & 2, I was not familiar with how to use git to track multiple projects in one repo. Those chapters are tracked in separate repos: 
	- [first_simple_program_1_11_lcpp](https://github.com/stephentobias/first_simple_program_1_11_lcpp)
	- [first_simple_program_1_11_lcpp_cmakebuild](https://github.com/stephentobias/first_simple_program_1_11_lcpp_cmakebuild)
	- [lcpp_ch1_quiz](https://github.com/stephentobias/lcpp_ch1_quiz)
	- [chapter_2](https://github.com/stephentobias/chapter_2)
	
I think I've figured out how to centralize everything so I don't end up with multiple repos for these lessons. This repo is my attempt at doing that. 

I may attempt to migrate the other repos into this one at some point but I need to figure out if I need to change the remote origin and how to do that without deleting the commit logs.
